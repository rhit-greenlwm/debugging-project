# TLDR-Python-Client

The first project we worked on was the [TLDR Python Client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-python-client) which is a python implementation of the "TLDR" page in linux. Normal "man" (manual) or help pages in linux are long and detailed, which is too much information for the average person using them. Additionally, these pages are difficult to read as they are not color coded. To help solve these issue, the TLDR project created simplified versions of the documentation for thousands of popular command line utilities. As it is written in python, it works on multiple platforms, but the primary user base is Linux. The TLDR project also offers shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, and tcsh.

# HTTPie/cli

The second project we explored was [HTTPie/cli](https://github.com/httpie/cli), a command-line HTTP client designed for API usage. Unlike tools like `curl`, HTTPie emphasizes readability and ease of use by formatting output in a visually appealing, colorized way (<- related to the bug we solved). It allows users to send HTTP requests easily and supports features such as JSON formatting and plugins. While it works across platforms, its primary users are developers and testers are on Linux based OSes.
